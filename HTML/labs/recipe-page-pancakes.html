                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat your nonstick skillet or pan to medium heat.</li>
                        <li>In one bowl, combine the flour and baking powder and mix well.</li>
                        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the eggs, milk, and ricotta. </li>
                        <li>In another bowl, melt the unsalted butter and mix it with the lemon juice and lemon zest.</li>
                        <li>Add the butter mixture to the milk mixture and stir to combine.</li>
                        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture and stir. Do not overmix.</li>
                        <li>Add butter to the pan just before cooking. Ladle batter into the pan and let it cook until the edges begin to
                        bubble.</li>
                        <li>Flip the pancake over and let it cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Remove from pan and place onto a plate.
                        Repeat as many times as you'd like (depending on how hungry you are!)</li>
                        <li>Serve immediately with your favourite toppings such as syrup or blueberries. These pancakes also taste great on
                        their own!</li>
                    </ol>
